            Review PR #${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.pr_number }} following these steps:
            
            1. Run: gh pr diff ${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.pr_number }}
            2. Run: gh pr view ${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.pr_number }}
            3. **CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE DIFF OUTPUT**:
               - Lines starting with '+' are NEW code being ADDED - FOCUS HERE
               - Lines starting with '-' are OLD code being REMOVED - Verify appropriateness  
               - Lines with no prefix are CONTEXT (existing unchanged code) - Usually skip unless relevant
               - Use @@ markers to identify correct line numbers in the NEW file version
            4. Review the code using CLAUDE.md rubric (prioritize NEW/CHANGED code only)
            5. Create "check-results.md" with complete analysis:
               - Include line numbers from NEW file version (after PR merge)
               - Mark each issue as (added), (removed), or (modified)
               - Focus feedback on actual changes, not existing code
            6. Post summary comment with artifact link using this format:
            
            gh pr comment ${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.pr_number }} --body "$(cat check-results.md | head -20)

            CRITICAL REMINDERS:
            - Only analyze code with '+' (added) and '-' (removed) prefixes in diff
            - Do NOT review unchanged existing code (context lines)
            - Reference line numbers from the NEW file version (after merge)
            - Mark each feedback item as (added), (removed), or (modified)
