- Run: `gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]` to get the complete diff
- Run: `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]` to get PR metadata
- Read all changed files mentioned in the diff

### Step 2: Analysis
Apply the scoring rubric below to each category.

### Step 3: Response Format
Use the EXACT format specified in the "Response Format" section below.
